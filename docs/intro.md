# What is Interstellar?
 

### A Decentralized Security Infrastructure for Dapps and Wallets
Interstellar Network is **not** a just wallet system but a **decentralized authentication and security infrastructure** that can be seamlessly integrated into any mobile application, including existing wallets, via a dedicated mobile SDK. Built on a **Substrate-based blockchain**, Interstellar provides a next-generation security model that eliminates the risks of centralized key storage while ensuring **regulatory compliance with strong authentication standards** such as **PSD2-SCA and FIDO2/WebAuthn**. Designed as a blockchain-native solution, it enables **smart account functionalities** directly at the protocol level, offering enterprises, institutions, and Web3 applications an unmatched level of security and flexibility.

### Advanced Cryptographic Security
At the core of Interstellar’s security framework is **advanced cryptographic authentication**, leveraging **Multi-Party Computation (MPC) and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs)** to protect users against evolving cyber threats. Unlike centralized authentication services that remain vulnerable to **credential leaks, phishing, and server breaches**, Interstellar ensures that **private keys are never exposed** and that every authentication event is cryptographically verified on-chain. This **zero-trust security model** enables highly secure transaction signing, multi-signature authentication, and **decentralized transaction validation** without relying on third-party intermediaries.

### Defense Against AI-Powered Phishing and Malware
Interstellar is designed to **counteract the exponential rise of phishing and malware attacks, which now leverage malicious AI for increasingly sophisticated exploits**. Traditional security frameworks—especially centralized authentication and key management solutions—are proving ineffective against AI-driven threats that can manipulate user interfaces, conduct large-scale credential phishing, and automate malware deployment. By decentralizing authentication and implementing **hardware-backed security layers**, Interstellar **mitigates the attack surface**, making it significantly harder for attackers to compromise user accounts, even if a device is infected.

### Smart Accounts and Seamless Integration
What sets Interstellar apart is its **smart account architecture**, implemented **directly within the blockchain itself**. This enables:
- **Instant Onborading**
- **Programmable account recovery**
- **Multi-device authentication**
- **Secure delegation of account access**
- **Bot-resistant transaction validation**
- **Bot-resistant digital asset distribution (airdrop)**
- **And much more....**

All of this is achieved **without requiring users to manage seed phrases or passwords**. These features, combined with Interstellar’s **decentralized authentication infrastructure**, provide a **scalable, regulatory-compliant, and future-proof** security solution that can be integrated into any mobile app. As blockchain adoption accelerates, **Interstellar sets a new industry standard** by delivering **institutional-grade security and compliance** without sacrificing user experience.
